# 🔍 About Me

I'm a motivated and self-driven individual with a strong interest in Cloud and DevOps technologies. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and to further develop my passion for IT and cloud engineering, I pursued an intensive AWS and DevOps Weiterbildung in Germany. This laid a strong foundation in cloud platforms, automation tools, and modern DevOps practices.

To gain practical experience, I took on a remote opportunity with Niyotech (USA), where I applied my knowledge in real-world DevOps scenarios. I supported tasks like infrastructure setup, Kubernetes deployment, and CI/CD pipeline configuration, which helped me strengthen my practical understanding.

In parallel, I earned the following certifications to validate and deepen my cloud knowledge:

#### 🏅 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

#### 🏅 AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

#### 🏅 Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate (AZ-104)

### Through this learning journey, I also developed and documented hands-on mini projects, including:

- Automating EC2, S3, IAM setups on AWS
- Writing Terraform scripts for VPC, EKS, and other infrastructure components
- Using Ansible to configure server environments and manage deployments
- Deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters (EKS, K3s) with basic understanding of manifests and Helm charts
- Setting up monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana for containerized applications
- Working with Docker to containerize applications and build images
- Implementing CI/CD pipeline steps with Jenkins and GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments
- Basic Linux system administration including user management, permissions, and networking fundamentals

#### I’m currently deepening my Kubernetes knowledge and preparing for:

📘 Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

📘 Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)

Additionally, I'm exploring Azure cloud services, using Terraform to automate deployments, and understanding how multi-cloud environments operate.

I’ve also implemented several self-driven projects and shared them on both my GitHub and technical blog, where I document how I approached each use case in detail.

### I’ve developed foundational, hands-on knowledge in tools like:

- Version control & collaboration: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- CI/CD & GitOps: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Argo CD
- Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana
- Security Tools: Trivy, SonarQube
- IaC & Automation: Terraform, Ansible
- Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure
- Scripting: Bash, Shell, basic Python
- Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes 

Through hands-on projects, remote internships, and ongoing self-learning, I’m continuously building practical experience and growing confidence in using these tools effectively across cloud and DevOps workflows.

### 🤝 What I’m Looking For

I’m now looking to collaborate with a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow further as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer. My main goal is to automate infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines, improve deployment workflows, and ensure reliability in cloud environments. I'm especially interested in working in an environment that encourages continuous improvement, mentorship, and hands-on problem-solving.

I'm a:
-  Continuous learner
-  Self-motivated professional
-  Reliable and adaptable team player
