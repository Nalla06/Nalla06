## 🔍 About Me

I’m a passionate and results-driven **DevOps Engineer** with 2–3 years of hands-on experience in:

- Designing and implementing **CI/CD pipelines**
- Managing **containerized applications**
- Building **cloud-native infrastructure** using Terraform and Ansible
- Deploying scalable **microservices** and **serverless** systems on AWS and Azure

My projects reflect practical solutions—deploying microservices, containerizing applications, automating CI/CD pipelines, and implementing serverless architectures on AWS. I believe in building scalable, secure, and highly available systems from the ground up, while fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
